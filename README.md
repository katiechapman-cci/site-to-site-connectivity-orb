# Site to Site Connectivity Orb

A CircleCI orb for establishing site to site connectivity via CircleCI tunnels to enable secure access to private repositories and resources during builds.

### Disclaimer:

## Overview

This orb provides commands to:
- Set up CircleCI tunnels with IP policy rules for secure access
- Checkout code from private repositories through the tunnel
- Clean up tunnel resources after the build

## Prerequisites

- An Ngrok account with API access, which is provided by CircleCI
- Ngrok API token stored as an environment variable (`NGROK_API_TOKEN`), which is provided by CircleCI
- An IP policy ID configured in your Ngrok account and stored as an environment variable (`IP_POLICY_ID`), which is provided by CircleCI

## Commands

### Setup

Sets up an CircleCI tunnel by creating an IP policy rule for the current CircleCI build's IP address.

**Parameters:**
- `ngrok-api-token` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the Ngrok API token (default: `NGROK_API_TOKEN`)
- `ip-policy-id` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the IP policy ID (default: `IP_POLICY_ID`)
- `tunnel-address` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the tunnel address (default: `TUNNEL_ADDRESS`)
- `tunnel-port` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the tunnel port (default: `TUNNEL_PORT`)
- `debug` (boolean): Enable debug logging (prints the curl command), default: `false`

**Exports:**
- `REPO_URL`: SSH URL to the repository via circleci tunnel
- `IPR_ID`: IP policy rule ID for cleanup

Note on env_var_name parameters:
- These parameters expect the NAME of an environment variable, not the value. The orb resolves the actual values at runtime via indirect expansion.

### checkout

Checks out code from a private repository via the circleci tunnel.

**Parameters:**
- `tunnel-address` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the tunnel address (default: `TUNNEL_ADDRESS`)
- `tunnel-port` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the tunnel port (default: `TUNNEL_PORT`)
- `git-url` (string): Repository URL (supports SSH scp-like `git@host:org/repo.git` and HTTPS/SSH URLs)
- `checkout-folder` (string): Folder to clone the repository into (default: `~/project`)
- `debug` (boolean): Enable debug logging (prints derived values), default: `false`

### cleanup

Removes the IP policy rule created during setup to clean up tunnel access.

**Parameters:**
- `ngrok-api-token` (env_var_name): Name of the env var containing the Ngrok API token (default: `NGROK_API_TOKEN`)
- `debug` (boolean): Enable debug logging, default: `false`
